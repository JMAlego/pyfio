# PyFIO - Python Interactive Othello

My winning entry into the University of York Blue Pi Thinking Competition for 2016. An interactive Othello game using a real Othello board and computer vision so you can play against a machine. 

A lot of dirty code which I'll probably clean up at some point. Piece detection needs some work still as well.
